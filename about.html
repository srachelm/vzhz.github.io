        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Veronica came to software engineering from the earth sciences, where she gained research experience in both academia and industry. There she got her first taste of object-oriented programming. She has worked in a geochemistry and paleomagnetism lab <!--which one? good info for nerdz-->and contributed to landing-site selection for the Mars Curiosity Rover <!--do you have a link for this group? that'd be cool for readers-->. After these projects, she began working on Python full-time, recently devoting three months to a deep dive into learning the language and general programming principles <!--is this accurate?-->at the Recurse Center.<!--wanted to avoid repeating "python" overly often. link to Recurse Center may also be cool--></p>

        <p>She hopes, one day, to be able to squeeze as much information out of large datasets as she learned to squeeze out of rocks.<!--best sentence--> In the meantime<!--"meanwhile" is a bit odd bc it implies simultaneity but "she hopes to be able to" is talking about the future-->, she is working on making the best personal website ever from the ground up and building a web app in Flask. Her other projects include some (rather addictive) terminal games and the <href="https://github.com/vzhz/friendly_terminal" target="_blank">Friendly Terminal</a> tool.</p>

        <p>Interests: backpacking, climbing, biking, piloting planes, science outreach, and finding new and unusual ingredients to put on pizza</p>
